Saved modules/towns can also be added to the global ModuOps Xchange, a repository of modules/towns from around the world. This allows the module/town to be used by anyone who is creating a layout for a setup. Operation Chiefs know to look in the ModuOps Xchange to locate the modules/towns needed for public display layouts such as those at a train show.

1. Select the module/town from the `Modules/Towns` list.
2. Click the `Save` button to save the module/town to your local hard drive. The module/town is saved to your local hard drive where it can be accessed at any time.

Save modules/towns to a location on your hard drive where you will be able to find the file again. Saving all modules/towns to the same directory on your local hard drive makes it easier to find the modules/town when you are creating a new layout.

:::warning
Module files are saved as a json text file. It is possible to open the file in any text editor. Changing any of the information in the saved module file is likely to break the module/town when it is added to a layout. So don't change anything in the saved module file if you decide to have a look :wink:
