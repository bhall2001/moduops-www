### File dialog sometimes show greyed out icons

You will sometimes see the file dialog appears with files greyed out. This is an issue I've seen with applications on Macs in general, not just ModuOps. It appears that the file dialog either takes a long time or fails at determining which files/folders are valid options for the application.

The good news is the file dialog is functioning as it should. You can select ModuOps data files even though they appear to be disabled.
