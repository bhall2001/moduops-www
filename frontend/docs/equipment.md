# Equipment Register

Every Railroad must have rolling stock to ship commodities. The Equipment Register creates the types of equipment available for use on the layout.

## New Equipment

To create new equipment, click the &quot;New&quot; button. This takes you to the **Edit Car Type** screen.

Items in **red** are required elements when defining your equipment.

Select the equipment's classification from the drop down list. The list contains standard classification for Equipment.

Select the era of the equipment from the Era drop down list. The options allow yard crews to select a car to best fit the era requested.

Add a short description of your equipment (12 characters max).

In many situations, ModuOps uses the short description of your equipment. There are a lot of options for how to use the short description. This could be a shortened version of the longer description, or possibly a code such as the standard AAR code for the equipment. For more information on AAR codes as they pertain to model railroads, we recommend the efforts of the Ops Sig group at [https://www.opsig.org/files/resources/AARFreightCarCodes.pdf](https://www.opsig.org/files/resources/AARFreightCarCodes.pdf).

The length of the equipment you define should be in scale feet. Make sure you stay consistent with the unit of measurement when defining other options requiring a length.

Remarks are optional when defining the equipment. The remarks are typically displayed on the output form when the car type is selected for use on a train. The remarks are intended for the crew handling the equipment and may contain information such as &quot;Hazardous&quot; or &quot;Flammable&quot;.

When you have finished entering all the equipment information on the form, click &quot;Done&quot;.

## Edit Equipment

To change information about an existing piece of equipment, double click on the item in the scrolling list on the Equipment Register screen.

You are taken to the **Edit Car Type** screen. Make any changes/corrections on this screen. Click &quot;Done&quot; when finished.

## Clone Equipment

It is common that you need to create a new piece of equipment that is very similar to another. Select the equipment in the Equipment Register screen and click &quot;Clone&quot;. An exact copy of the equipment is made and you are taken to the **Edit Car Type** screen.

Make any changes needed to the equipment. The original equipment is left unchanged by this process.

After you have made all your changes, click the &quot;Done&quot; button.

## Delete Equipment

In the Equipment Register screen, select the Equipment to be deleted form the scrolling list. Click the &quot;Delete&quot; button.

You are asked to confirm your desire to delete the item. THIS CAN NOT BE UNDONE. If you are sure you would like to delete the item, click &quot;Yes&quot;.

:::caution
Deleting equipment also deletes any related items including Consignee requests for the Equipment.
