# 8. Train Route

Now that we have a train, let's create a route for it to follow.

1. Click the line for `TRAIN1` to highlight it in the list of trains on the train screen.

2. Now, click the `Route` button. This action opens the train route screen.

Double-clicking a train will also open the train route screen.

3. In the upper left of the screen, you'll find the modules/towns that are in the layout. The right side of the screen contains the route sequence the train will follow. Currently, we have a very basic layout with only 1 consignee. We'll make things a little more interesting shortly.

4. For now, in the Modules/Towns list, click once on `Somewhere in the world` to highlight it. In the simplest cases, a train can service all consignees at a module/town. We'll do that for our tutorial.

5. Once `Somewhere in the world` is highlighted, click the right arrow between the two scrolling fields.

This action will add `Somewhere in the world` to the train's route. The default action is for the train to handle requests for all Consignees, which you can see listed on the train's route. The right side of the screen will summarize this action for us.

6. Click `Done` to return to the train screen.

This step ensures that `TRAIN1` has a designated route to follow, including servicing the consignee at `Somewhere in the world`.
