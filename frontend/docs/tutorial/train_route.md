# 8. Train Route

Now that we have a train, we will create a route for the train to follow. Click the line for `TRAIN1` to highlight the line in the list of trains on the train screen.

Now click the `Route` button. This opens the train route screen.

In the upper left of the screen are the modules/towns that are in the layout. The right side of the screen contains the route sequence the train will follow. Right now we have a very basic layout with only 1 consignee. We'll make things a little more interesting in just a bit.

For now, in the Modules/Towns list, click once on `Somewhere in the world` to highlight it. In the most simple of cases, a train can service all consignees at a module/town. We will do that for our tutorial.

Once `Somewhere in the world` is highlighted, click the right arrow between the 2 scrolling fields to add all consignees at Somewhere in the world to the train's route. The right side of the screen will summarize this action for us.

Click `Done` to return to the train screen.
