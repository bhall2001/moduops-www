# 4. Create Drop Zone

Next we need to establish a specific section of track where equipment can be dropped in ModuOps.

1. Navigate to the right half of the `Modules/Towns` screen and click on the tab labeled `Drop Zones`. This will show a list of all the currently defined drop zones.

2. Click `New` under the column marked as `Drop Zones`. This action opens the Drop Zone edit screen.

On the Drop Zone edit screen, we need to provide two essential pieces of information when creating a new drop zone:

- name of the drop zone
- length of the drop zone

In many cases, the name the drop zone will be the same name as a Consignee. ModuOps offers the flexibility to either type in a name or select a Consignee from a menu of all Consignees defined for the module. In ths tutorial, we will select our consignee from the menu.

1. Select `Warehouse` from the `Use Consignee Name` popup menu. This automatically assigns the name of the Consignee as the name of the drop zone.

2. Enter `100` in the drop zone `Length` field. This indicates that the drop zone's length is set to 100 feet.

3. Click `Done` to return to the `Modules/Towns` screen. Your tutorial layout now boasts a designated section of track where equipment can be dropped.
