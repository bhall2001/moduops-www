# 4. Create Drop Zone

Next up we need to setup a section of track where equipment can be dropped. Click `New` over the column marked as `Drop Zones`. On the Drop Zone screen we must define 2 pieces of information to create a new drop zone, the name and length of the drop zone.

In many cases it may be desirable to name the drop zone after the name of the Consignee. ModuOps allows you to either type in a name or select from a menu that shows all the Consignees that are defined in the module/town.

Select `Warehouse` from the `Use Consignee Name` pop up menu. This assigns the name of the Consignee as the name of the drop zone.

Now type in 100 in the drop zone `Length` field. This indicates the length of the drop zone is 100 feet.

Click `Done` to return to the `Modules/Towns screen. Our fake layout now has a section of track defined where equipment can be dropped.
