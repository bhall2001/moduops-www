# 3. Create Consignee

On the `Modules/Towns` screen, click `New` over the column marked for `Consignees`. Name the consignee `Warehouse`. The name is the only required item when creating a Consignee. Click `Create`.

Our new Consignee is created.

:::warning
You will see an error on the Consignee screen once you create the new Consignee. This is because at this point in time we have not created any drop zones. Once we create a drop zone, this error will go away. For now, you can ignore this error.
:::

Click `Done` to return to the `Modules/Towns` screen. Our new Consignee is listed on our Somewhere in the world module/town.
