# 10. Add a Drop Zone

Our tutorial has the most basic of layouts to service. We will make things more interesting by creating another consignee with an additional drop zone to service.

Click the `Modules/Towns` sidebar menu. Click `Somewhere in the world` to highlight the module.

Click `New` over the drop zones list to create a new drop zone. Name the drop zone "Team Track" with a length of 300.

Click `Done` to return to the Modules/Towns screen.

## Add a Consignee

Click the `New` button over the Consignees list.

Type "Team Track" into the `Consignee` field.

Click `Create` to create the new Consignee.

## New Equipment Request

Now we can create a new equipment request. Click `New Request` to create a new request for the team track.

Now select the Team Track drop zone and 50 foot box car to highlight both the lines for the equipment request.

Set the `Cars/Week` to 2. This will increase the probability that this request is selected over requests that are for 1 car per week.

Click `Done` to return to the Consignee screen.

Click `Done` again to return to the Modules/Towns screen.

## Adjust Minimum Train Length

Let's make things more interesting for our train. We'll set a minimum length of the train. This will vary the number of cars that are added to each train.

Click `Trains` in the left sidebar menu. Now select `TRAIN1` and then press the `Edit` button. In the `Min Length` field, enter 150.

Click `Done` to return to the Trains screen.

## Generate Trainlist

Now we have 2 Consignees and 2 drop zones to service with our train. Click `Trainlists` in the left sidebar. Click to hilite `TRAIN1`, then click `Generate Trainlist`.

ModuOps randomly selects equipment to add the the trainlist based on the value of CPW, the drop zones the train can service at the modules on the train's route and the train length. This results in varied work needing to be performed on our layout.

Click the `Generate Trainlist` multiple times to see how the equipment requests vary.

**CONGRATULATIONS!!!** You have completed the tutorial for ModuOps.
