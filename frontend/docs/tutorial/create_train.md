# 7. Create Train

Now that we have a Consignee requesting equipment and a yard to originate from, it's time to create a train.

In the left sidebar menu click `Trains`. This navigates us to the train screen.

Now click `New` to create a train. For the symbol enter `TRAIN1`. The origin and destination will be our Rail Yard. Select `Rail Yard` in the popup menu for origin and destination.

The last required bit of information we need for the train is to set the desired length of the train. This number is the maximum potential length of equipment that could be added to a train.

:::note
Train length does not include the length of motive power or caboose. The value is the length of equipment that could be added to a train.
:::

In our example we are referencing lengths in feet. For this tutorial we can leave the default value that was entered when the train was created.

Click `Create` to create the train.

Awesome, we now have all the basic information we need for our new train. Now we need to create a route for the train to follow.
