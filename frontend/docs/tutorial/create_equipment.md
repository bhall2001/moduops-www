# 1. Create Equipment

When getting started with ModuOps, the initial step is to create equipment capable of hauling goods for your layout. In ModuOps, equipment is referenced by type rather than reporting marks, a distinctive feature of the application.

## Creating a 50-Foot Box Car

1. Navigate to the `Equipment Register` in the left sidebar menu.
2. Click on the `New` button to create a new piece of equipment.
3. In the `Classification` popup menu, select `X - Box`.
4. Provide the following details:

   - `Car Description:` Enter `Boxcar`.
   - `Short Description:` Enter `Box`.
   - `Length:` Enter `50` to indicate the length as 50 feet.

Fields with a red label are required in ModuOps.

5. Click the `Done` button to return to the Equipment Register screen.

The 50-foot boxcar is now displayed in the equipment registry.

Now you have a single piece of equipment ready to be scheduled on a train. This process lays the foundation for efficiently managing equipment in ModuOps.
