# 1. Create Equipment

The first step when starting out is to create equipment that can haul goods for our layout. In ModuOps, equipment is referenced by type not by reporting marks. This is a key feature of the application.

To get things started, we will create a 50 foot box car.

Click `Equipment Register` in the left sidebar menu. This takes you to the Equipment Register screen. Now click the `New` button. A new piece of equipment is created.

Next we need to add the details of the equipment. In the `Classification` popup menu select `X - Box`. In the `Car Description:` field enter `Boxcar`. In the field labeled `Short Description:` enter `Box`. In the length field enter `50` indicating the length is 50 feet.

:::note
Fields with a red label are required in ModuOps.

Click `Done` in the left sidebar menu to return to the Equipment Register screen. The 50 foot boxcar is now displayed in the equipment registry.

We now have a single piece of equipment that we can schedule on a train.
