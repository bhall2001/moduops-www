# 2. Create Module

Next up we need to create a Module for our layout. Click `Modules/Towns` in the left sidebar. Now click the `New` button over the column marked `Modules/Towns`. A new module is created.

We need to add some basic information for the module. Let's name our module by typing `Somewhere in the world` in the `Name` field and `Somewhere` in the short field. There are other fields you can fill in but they are all optional. Click `Done`.

Our new module "Somewhere in the world" is listed as a Module/Town in our layout.

## Module key concepts

ModuOps modules/towns have 2 very important concepts -- they contain consignees and drop zones.

A consignee is a business that either produces or consumes commodities. Consignees generate equipment requests resulting in specific equipment being delivered on a train.

Drop zones are sections of track where equipment can be dropped. A drop zone can be defined as the full length of a siding, there may be multiple drop zones per siding, or a drop zone could even be longer than the physical siding.

With these ideas in mind, we will create our first Consignee and drop zone for our layout.
