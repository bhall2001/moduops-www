# 2. Create Module

Moving forward, let's create a Module for our layout in ModuOps. Modules are standard nomenclature typically used with modular layouts. If you are setting up your home or a club layout with ModuOps, you can use Towns synonymously with modules.

## Define a module

1. Click `Modules/Towns` in the left sidebar.
2. Click the `New` button located in the column marked `Modules/Towns` to create a new module.

Now, let's add some basic information for the module:

- In the `Name` field, type `Somewhere in the world`.
- In the `Short` field, type `Somewhere`.

There are additional optional fields you can fill in, but for now, let's keep it simple. Click `Done`.

Your new module, "Somewhere in the world," is now listed as a Module/Town in our layout.

## Module Key Concepts

ModuOps modules/towns revolve around two crucial concepts: consignees and drop zones.

### Consignees

A consignee is a business that either produces or consumes commodities. Consignees generate equipment requests, leading to specific equipment being delivered on a train.

### Drop Zones

Drop zones are sections of track where equipment can be dropped. Drop zones can be defined as the full length of a siding or as having multiple drop zones per siding. In fact, a drop zone could even be longer than the physical siding.

With these concepts in mind, let's proceed to create our first Consignee and drop zone for our layout.
