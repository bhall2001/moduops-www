# 9. Generate Trainlist

Now the final step is to generate a trainlist for crews to use while operating the layout. In the left sidebar click `Trainlists` to navigate to the trainlists screen. The screen will show all the trains that have been created.

Now click `TRAIN1` to highlight it. This is how we tell ModuOps which train we would like to generate a trainlist for.

We will leave all the default settings as they are for our tutorial. Once a train is selected, click the "Generate Trainlist" button. A small preview of the created trainlist is displayed.

:::note
The preview is intended to show you in general that a trainlist was created and what it will look like once printed. The preview is not intended to be readable.

Now that we have created a trainlist, the next step is to print the trainlist. On the Trainlist screen click the `Print` button to print the trainlist.
