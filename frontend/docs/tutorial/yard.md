# 6. Create Yard

In ModuOps, all trains must originate from and return to a yard. This requires designating at least one module/town on the layout as a Yard.

1. In the `Modules/Towns` column, click `New` to create a new module/town. Set the name to "Rail Yard" and the short name to "Yard".

:::note
You can name modules/towns whatever you want. For the purpose of this tutorial, we are using generic names, but feel free to use any name you prefer.

2. Click `Done` to return to the `Modules/Towns` screen.

3. Ensure the "Rail Yard" module is highlighted in the list of modules.

In ModuOps, a yard is a special kind of drop zone. This drop zone is created just like other drop zones, except that the length provided will indicate the total length of all track in the yard, and a flag must be set indicating to ModuOps that this drop zone is a yard.

We will create our yard drop zone in the "Rail Yard" module/town we just created.

4. On the right half of the `Modules/Towns` screen, click the tab labeled "Drop Zones".

5. Click `New` under the `Drop Zones` column to create a new drop zone. Type "Rail Yard" for the name and give it a length of 500.

:::note
When determining the length for yard drop zones, set the value to the total capacity of **ALL** tracks in the yard.
:::

For this tutorial, we enter 500, indicating the total capacity of all tracks in the yard is equivalent to 500 feet.

6. The last step in setting up a yard drop zone is to click the checkbox next to `Yard/Interchange/Staging`. When a check mark appears here, this tells ModuOps that this drop zone is a yard.

7. Click `Done` to return to the `Modules/Towns` screen.

This step ensures that your layout has a designated yard, a crucial element for train origination and termination.
