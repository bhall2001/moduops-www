# 6. Create Yard

In ModuOps all trains must originate from and return to a yard. This requires that there be at least 1 module/town on the layout that is designated as a Yard.

In the Modules/Towns column click `New` to create a new module/town. Set the name to "Rail Yard" and the short name to "Yard".

:::note
You can name modules/towns whatever you want. For the purpose of this tutorial we are using generic names but you can use any name you want.

Click `Done` to return to the Modules/Towns screen.

Make sure the "Rail Yard" module is highlighted in the list of modules.

Click `New` over the Drop Zones column to create a new drop zone. Type "Rail Yard" for the name and give it a length of 500. When determining the length for a drop zone that will be a yard, set the value to the total capacity of **ALL** tracks in the yard.

For this tutorial we enter 500 indicating the total capacity of all tracks in the yard is equivalent to 500 feet.

Now the last step to turn this drop zone into a yard is to click the checkbox next to "Yard/Interchange/Staging". When a check mark appears here, this tells ModuOps that this drop zone is a yard.

Click `Done` to return to the Modules/Towns screen.
