# ModuOps Tutorial

## Tutorial Intro

Let's discover ModuOps in about 15 minutes. The tutorial is for a very basic layout but the concepts learned will apply to larger layouts. The hope is that you will learn the basic recipe for using the application and can then apply that learning to your own layout.

The tutorial is split up into separate sections. On the left you'll find each of the sections in a menu. You should go through each of the steps in order. Going out of order will result in the tutorial not working as expected.

## Getting Started

The first thing we need to do is create a new layout file to hold our data.

Double click the ModuOps application to run it. Once the application is running, select "New Layout..." from the File menu. A file dialog opens. Name the file "myLayout.mop2" and save it at a location where you will be able to find it again.

Once the file is created you can click "OK" to close the dialog that appears.

For this tutorial will start with a very simple scenario. We will have one piece of equipment that one Consignee will request. Not complicated but this demonstrates the basic steps for using ModuOps.
