# 5. Equipment Requests

Now, we need to create an equipment requests for our Consignee This will bring our tutorial layout to life.

1. On the right half of the `Modules/Towns` screen, click the tab labeled `Consignees`. You will see our single consignee `Warehouse`.

2. Click on `Warehouse` to select the line in the consignee list.

3. Click `Edit` under the column marked for `Consignees`.

In ModuOps, most lists allow you to double-click a line. In most cases, this will open the edit screen for the item that was clicked.

You may recall encountering an error on the consignee edit screen for the Warehouse previously. The error message has now disappeared since we have defined a drop zone. We can now proceed to create new equipment requests for the consignee.

4. Click the `New Request` button in the Equipment Requests section. This action opens the Equipment Request edit screen. Here, you will define the type of equipment needed, the drop zone to which the equipment will be dispatched, and the frequency of the requests.

5. On the Equipment Request screen, click on the `50 foot box car` to highlight the line. This indicates that this request is for a 50-foot box car.

6. Click on the `Warehouse` drop zone to highlight it. This indicates that the car request is for the drop zone named `Warehouse`.

7. Finally, you can specify how many "Cars Per Week" (CPW) the request will be made. This is not an actual value but rather a relative value. In more complex layouts, the CPW value is used for weighted random selection against all equipment requests on a train's route.

8. eave the default CPW value of `1`.

9. Click `Done` to return to the Consignee screen. You will now see our new Equipment Request listed on the screen.

10. Click `Done` again to return to the `Modules/Towns` screen.

This step ensures that our consignee, Warehouse, is ready to generate requests for equipment, adding dynamism to our tutorial layout.
