# 5. Equipment Requests

Next up we need to setup the request our Consignee will make for equipment. Click `Warehouse` to highlight the Consignee in the Consignee list. Next click `Edit` over the column marked for `Consignees`.

You will see our error message has gone away now that we have a drop zone defined. Now we will create a new request for our Warehouse consignee.

Click `New Request` button in the Equipment Request section. This will open the Equipment Request screen. Here you will define the type or equipment needed, the drop zone that equipment will be sent to and the frequency of the requests.

Now this is a simple tutorial at this point so we do not have a lot of options. On the Equipment request screen click on our 50 foot box car to highlight the line. This indicates that this request is for a 50 foot box car.

Next click on the Warehouse drop zone to highlight the drop zone. This indicates that this car request is for the drop zone named Warehouse.

Finally, you can indicate how many "Cars Per Week" (CPW) the request will be made. This is not an actual value but rather is a relative value. When we have a more complex layout, the cars per week value is used as a weighted random selection value against all equipment requests that could be scheduled.

For now, we can leave the default value of 1 for CPW.

Click `Done` to return to the Consignee screen. You will now see our new Equipment Request is listed on the screen.

Click `Done` again to return to the Module/Town screen.
