# Consignees

Consignees are businesses that request railroad equipment, which is then delivered by trains to designated drop zones on the layout. These businesses may have exclusive access to particular drop zones or may share them with others. In either scenario, consignees submit requests for specific equipment to be delivered to specific drop zones.

Consignees play a crucial role in the layout's activity. Without them, there would be no operations taking place.

2. Select a module/town.
3. Click the `Consignees` tab on the right of the Modules/Towns screen.
