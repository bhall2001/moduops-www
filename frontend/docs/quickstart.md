# Quickstart Guide

Don't want to read the whole manual? Here are the steps you need to get ModuOps up and functioning. You still should read the manual though ;-)

Here's the order you'll want to follow to get going.

1. Create a few pieces of Equipment
2. Create a Module/Town for your sourcing yard
3. Create a Drop Zone for a Yard. Be sure to select `Yard/Interchange/Staging` and set the length to the total storage capacity of the yard.
4. Create a Module/Town
5. Create a Consignee (Industry) or 2 – Enter the name in the Consignee field
6. Create a couple of Drop Zones - Enter the Name and length of track associated with a Consignee where cars are set out
7. Return to the Consignee details screen and add Car Requests – Select a Consignee and click on `Edit` to get to car requests
8. Repeat steps 2 – 5 for the remaining Modules, Drop Zones and Consignees on your layout
9.  Create a Train
10. Give the Train a Route. Set the origin/destination to the yard created above
11. Generate a Trainlist for your new Train
12. Take the Trainlist to your layout and get to work ;-)
