# Reports

ModuOps offers basic reports. Reports display data in a tabular format. Reports can be printed or in some cases, exported to either a comma separated values (csv) or tab separated values (tsv) formatted file. These files can be opened in a spreadsheet application for further manipulation.

## Equipment Register

The equipment register report lists all equipment in the current layout. The data can be sorted by any column in the table. Once the data is sorted as desired, the report can be printed.

## Modules/Towns Summary Listing

The Modules/Town Summary Listing report provides a high level overview of the Modules/Town in the current layout. The report shows the number of consignees, drop zones and equipment requests for each Modules/Town. The report can be sorted by any column in the table. Once the data is sorted as desired, the report can be printed.

## Equipment Request Report

The Equipment Request report lists all equipment requests for Modules in the current layout. The report can be filtered by module name or module owner. The report is always filtered by module name alphabetically as well as additional columns in the table. It is not possible to change the filter order.

The report has an option to show or hide 2 fields -- the equipment AAR code and the short description for the equipment. The columns menu located to the upper right of the data table offers the ability to select the field(s) to hide or show in the report.

The report can be exported to either a comma separated value (csv) file, a tab separated value (tsv) file, or printed. Exporting the report to a csv or tsv file allows the report to be opened in a spreadsheet application for additional manipulation.

### Known issue

Csv and tsv files may not be saved to Google drives. A workaround when needing to save a csv or tsv file to a Google drive is to first save the file to your local filesystem, then move the file to the Google drive.
