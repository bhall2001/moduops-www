# ModuOps Xchange

Introducing the ModuOps Xchange, a groundbreaking feature offering users access to a shared repository of modules from around the globe. By leveraging this platform, ModuOps users can seamlessly integrate modules into their layouts, enriching their model railroading experiences.

## How it works

Modules are contributed to the Xchange by sending module files to Bob Hall via email or by submitting pull requests to the ModuOps Xchange Github repository. These modules are then accessible for addition to any layout within ModuOps.

With the ModuOps Xchange mounted directly to your local file system, accessing and incorporating available modules becomes effortless.
