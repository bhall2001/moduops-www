# FAQ

## Why do yards not show any cars when I select it on the Yard screen?

This can happen when the yard is not included as an origination point for any train in the current layout file. Once the yard is added as an origin for a train, car types should be displayed.

## You need to add a Save option in the File menu.

ModuOps automatically saves your work while using the application. Because of this there is no Save option in the File menu.

## I am not able to close my data file. Why is there no Close menu item?

I do not see the reason to offer the ability to close your data file. If you are closing the file there must be something you are looking to do after closing the file -- opening another file, creating a new file or quitting the application.

Rather than create an extra unneeded step of closing the file, continue on with whatever you are needing to do next. ModuOps will take care of closing the file for you.
