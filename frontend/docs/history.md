# ModuOps History

Welcome to ModuOps!

ModuOps came into being from a desire by the New England Free-mo group to create a car routing system. The primary goal was to reduce the amount of administration needed to get a Modular layout up and operating.

ModuOps finds it's roots in a package called "Mad River and Big Timber" \(MRBT for short\). MRBT came from a Modular group in California in the 90s. Their goal was also to get a Modular layout up and running with minimal administrative overhead.

MRBT was a product of the late 90s and appears to have seen its last update in the year 2000. The New England Free-mo group used old laptops up until about 2015 to run the MRBT software. However, there are just too many challenges in doing that in today's modern world.

ModuOps essentially replicates the MRBT software package with some changes. The application has a modern graphical user interface \(GUI\). Routing logic is more sophisticated than the original MRBT. The hooks are in place to take ModuOps online and integrate today's modern smartphone and tablet technologies.

For those who care, ModuOps is written in [Livecode](https://livecode.com). Livecode is a modern, rapid development tool incorporating a number of advanced capabilities. ModuOps uses a SQLite database and is available on Windows and Macintosh systems.
