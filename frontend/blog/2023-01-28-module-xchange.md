# Introducing the ModuOps Xchange

ModuOps simplifies operations on modular layouts, making it an invaluable tool for those creating operating plans. However, finding the necessary modules for a specific layout has proven challenging. To address this, I've developed the ModuOps Xchange – a central repository for modules, easily accessible on the Internet, and organized for efficient navigation.

## Worldwide Module Repository

The Xchange adheres to international conventions for locating geographical regions worldwide. My vision is to create a global community where ModuOps users can seamlessly share their modules.

As an Ops Chief, you can effortlessly integrate modules from the Xchange into your layouts.

## Easy Access

The Xchange significantly reduces the administrative overhead required to set up a modular layout. By mounting the Module Xchange to your desktop file system, accessing modules becomes effortless. Adding a module to a layout is now as simple as incorporating it from the local file system into ModuOps.

## How It Works

At its core, the Module Xchange operates as a Github repository for modules. If you're unfamiliar with Github, no worries – it helps maintain version histories of modules. Initially, the Module Xchange is published as a Google Drive public readonly shared directory. Anyone seeking access can use the publicly available link to the repository's root.

A noteworthy feature of Google Drive is the ability to mount shared links to your local file system. As a result, the Xchange is always accessible on your local file system, making it easy to add modules from the Xchange to a ModuOps layout!

## Add the Module Xchange to your desktop
