Welcome to the **new** ModuOps website!

There are a lot of changes here at the website as you can see. The hosting provider of the old site went belly up leaving me high and dry. Luckily I had a backup of the old content. However I decided to start over.

The new site uses [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) for the engine. I've gone with simplicity for this site. I find the layout and navigation are easy to pickup and  for those wanting to help out everything on the site is markdown files (with a little React thrown in).

I've also gone serverless! That's right, there isn't a server running this site. The website is made up of static html files that live on Amazon Web Services. This gives the site a nice performance boost, will be cheaper to operate and I'm hoping that Amazon will not go out of business during the rest of my tenure.

Downloading ModuOps is super easy with buttons on the home page for Mac and Windows. I'm busy adding documentation which was sorely needed. Since you're reading this you'll also notice I'm starting the Blog (again).

Some are aware of a new version in the works. I hope to have the work on that wrapped up soon. Look for a post here with the details of the new release.

Let me know what you think of the new site. I'm hoping you find it as nice to use as I've found it to develop.

-Bob
