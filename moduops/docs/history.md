# ModuOps History

Welcome to ModuOps!

ModuOps was born out of the New England Free-mo group's need to streamline car routing for model railroad operations. The primary aim was to simplify the administrative tasks required to set up and manage a Modular layout effectively.

Rooted in the legacy of the "Mad River and Big Timber" (MRBT) system developed by a California-based Modular group in the 1990s, ModuOps builds upon this foundation with modern enhancements. While MRBT served its purpose well, its last update was in 2000, and using outdated laptops to run the software became increasingly impractical as time progressed.

ModuOps preserves the core functionalities of MRBT while introducing significant improvements. It features a modern graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced user experience and incorporates more sophisticated routing logic.

ModuOps isn't limited to Free-mo layouts; it's utilized by various modular clubs, static club layouts, and home setups alike. With its versatility, ModuOps offers a convenient solution to introduce operational dynamics to any model railroad layout effortlessly!

For those interested, ModuOps is developed using [Livecode](https://livecode.com), a cross platform, rapid development tool. ModuOps is compatible with both Windows and Macintosh systems, ensuring accessibility for a wide range of users.
