# 10. Add a Drop Zone

Our tutorial layout does not have much work available. Let's make things more interesting by creating another consignee with an additional drop zone to service.

1. Click the `Modules/Towns` sidebar menu. Click `Somewhere in the world` to highlight the module.

2. On the right half of the screen, click the `Drop zones` tab to list the drop zones for the module/town.

3. Click `New` under the drop zones list to create a new drop zone. Name the drop zone `Team Track` with a length of 300.

4. Click `Done` to return to the `Modules/Towns` screen.

## Add a Consignee

1. On the right half of the screen, click the `Consignees` tab to list the consignees for our module/town.

2. Click the `New` button under the Consignees list.

3. Type `Bob's Hardware` into the `Consignee` field.

4. Click `Create` to create the new Consignee.

## New Equipment Request

Now we can create a new equipment request.

1. Click `New Request` to create a new request for the team track.

2. Select the Team Track drop zone and 50-foot box car to highlight both lines for the equipment request.

3. Set the `Cars/Week` to 2. This will increase the probability that this request is selected over requests that are for 1 car per week.

:::tip
Team tracks are an interesting kind of drop zone. In the 1:1 scale world, it is common for team tracks to be shared by more than 1 consignee.

In ModuOps, we can replicate that behavior by creating multiple consignees all with equipment requests for the `Team Track` drop zone. This enables the Team Track to be shared by more than 1 consignee on our layout.

1. Click `Done` to return to the Consignee screen.

2. Click `Done` again to return to the `Modules/Towns` screen.

## Adjust Minimum Train Length

Let's make things more interesting for our train by setting a minimum length of the train.

1. Click `Trains` in the left sidebar menu.

2. Select `TRAIN1` and then click the `Edit` button.

3. In the `Min Length` field, enter 150.

:::info
When utilizing the minimum train length field in ModuOps, it is defined as the minimum allowable length that a train cannot exceed. This implies that the train's length can range up to, but not surpass, this specified length. Consequently, in practice, train lengths can fall below this defined value, which is entirely anticipated.

1. Click `Done` to return to the `Trains` screen.

## Generate Trainlist

Now we have 2 Consignees and 2 drop zones to service with our train. We do not need to update the train's route because we already have the train servicing all Consignees at our module/town Somewhere in the World.

1. Click `Trainlists` in the left sidebar. Click to highlight `TRAIN1`, then click `Generate Trainlist`.

In ModuOps, equipment selection for the trainlist is randomized, taking into account factors such as train length, drop zones, modules along the train's route, and the CPW value for equipment requests. This approach ensures that the generated tasks feel organic and naturally varied, enhancing the layout's realism.

1. Click the `Generate Trainlist` multiple times to see how the equipment requests vary.
