# 3. Create Consignee

Now, let's create a Consignee for our module in ModuOps.

1. On the `Modules/Towns` screen, click to select our module `Somewhere in the world`.
2. Click the `Consignee` tab on the right half of the screen to display the list of consignees for our module.
3. Under the column marked `Consignees`, click `New` to create a new consignee.
4. Name the consignee `Warehouse`. The name is the only required item when creating a Consignee.
5. Click `Create`.

Congratulations! Your new Consignee, "Warehouse," is now created.

:::warning
You may notice an error on the Consignee screen after creating the new Consignee. Don't worry; this error is expected at this point because we haven't created any drop zones yet. Once we create a drop zone, this error will be resolved. Feel free to ignore it for now.

5. Click `Done` to return to the `Modules/Towns` screen. Your new Consignee is now listed in the "Somewhere in the world" module/town.

Now, let's proceed to create a drop zone to resolve the error.
