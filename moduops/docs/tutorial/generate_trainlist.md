# 9. Generate Trainlist

Now, for the final step, let's generate a trainlist for crews to use while operating the layout. Trainlists are the crew instructions needed to operate a train on the layout.

1. In the left sidebar, click `Trainlists` to navigate to the trainlists screen. The screen will show all the trains that have been created.

2. Now, click `TRAIN1` to highlight it. This is how we tell ModuOps which train we would like to generate a trainlist for.

3. Leave all the default settings as they are for our tutorial.

4. Click the "Generate Trainlist" button. A small preview of the created trainlist is displayed on the right side of the screen.

The preview is intended to give you a general idea that a trainlist was created and what it will look like once printed. The preview is not intended to be readable.

4. Now that we have created a trainlist, the next step is to print it. On the Trainlist screen, click the `Print` button to print the trainlist.

5. With the trainlist printed, the crew is ready to grab a throttle, some power, and get to work!

But hold on! Let's add a little more interest to our tutorial layout. :wink:
